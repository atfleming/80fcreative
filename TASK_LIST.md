## üìù Notes & Context

### Recent Development Context
- Fixed major loading issues on Vercel deployment by removing spaces from file paths
- Discovered that photography directories with spaces caused 404 errors in production
- Successfully implemented video autoplay with proper fallbacks
- Git LFS properly configured for large media files (1.2GB+ of photos/videos)

### Known Issues
- Some photography directory renaming still in progress
- Large file commits occasionally fail due to size limits
- Mobile video performance needs testing

### Next Session Priorities
1. Complete README.md update [High Priority]
2. Finish photo directory organization [Medium Priority]
3. Implement error handling [High Priority]
