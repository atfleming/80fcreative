		"The University of Memphis is a cornerstone of regional education and culture, preparing to open the Scheidt Performing Arts Centerâ€”an innovative home for students, faculty, and the Memphis arts community.",
	challenge:
		"With the Scheidt Performing Arts Center nearing completion, donor momentum slowed. The brief called for a straightforward informational film, but 80F Creative saw the need to spark an emotional response that could reignite support.",
	solution:

Interviews, staged lighting inside the unfinished space, and projections of architectural plans showcased how the new building would transform lives, all scored with an original composition designed to build resonance.",
	results:
		"The finished film moved the client and their donor base. When the University distributed it through their newsletter, donor engagement surged and the remaining funding was secured, ensuring the Scheidt Performing Arts Center could open its doors and serve the community for decades.",
