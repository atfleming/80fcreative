Case Study: Stax Records
The Memphis Masters: Connecting a New Generation to a Timeless Legacy

Bridging the generational gap for an iconic music label with a cinematic documentary web series.

The Client
Stax Records, one of the most iconic and culturally significant soul music labels in history, promoting its new high-definition "Memphis Masters" remasters.

The Challenge
Stax Records needed to connect its timeless catalogue to a new, younger generation of fans. The business goal was to drive interest in their new pristine remasters by helping modern listeners understand the profound and continuing influence of the Stax legends on the music they love today.

The Solution
80F Creative was hired to create "The Memphis Masters," a documentary web series designed to bridge the legacy to the now. Our creative strategy was to let modern music speak for itself. We interviewed popular contemporary artists, allowing them to share personal stories of how Stax legends influenced their own sound.

To honor the timeless nature of the music, we shot the entire series in a classic, cinematic black-and-white film style. This aesthetic choice created a visual bridge between the past and present, giving the interviews a feeling of premium, historic importance. This approach allowed new fans to discover the music through the trusted voices of artists they already admire.

The Results
The "Memphis Masters" series successfully bridged the generational gap, framing the Stax catalogue as a living, breathing influence, not just a relic of the past. The series helped fans understand and appreciate the connection between their favorite artists and the Stax legends, driving renewed interest and engagement (150k+ organic views) for the new, pristine remasters and introducing the Stax legacy to a new generation of listeners.
