Case Study: Memphis 901 FC
Launching a Pro Soccer Team with the Soul of Memphis

Forging an authentic identity for a new sports franchise by rooting it in the city's rich cultural history.

The Client
Memphis 901 FC, a new professional soccer club preparing to launch its inaugural season in the USL Championship.

The Challenge
As a brand-new team, Memphis 901 FC needed to build a fanbase from scratch. To succeed in Memphis, they couldn't just be another sports team; they needed to be Memphis's team. The client required a launch campaign that felt authentic, energetic, and deeply connected to the local cultureâ€”something that only a partner who truly understood the city could deliver.

The Solution
80F Creative developed a high-energy brand film that introduced the new team as an extension of the city's unique identity. We dove deep into the city's culture, weaving together Memphis's own soccer history with its legendary soul music history.

To capture the city's unmistakable grit and passion, the piece was built around a high-octane, edgy script delivered by Memphis icon Al Kapone. This was paired with a classic soul track, given a modern remix by the legendary Royal Studios. The result was an energetic and impactful introduction that wasn't just a sports promo, but a cultural statement.

The Results
The brand reveal film was a massive success, galvanizing the city and generating huge fan excitement. It set an authentic, energetic tone for the club's inaugural year, helping 901 FC forge a strong, immediate connection with the community and launch a successful first season built on a genuine foundation of Memphis pride.
