description under title: "Driving Legacy Donations Through Cinematic Storytelling:

Securing the future of the arts in Memphis by turning an informational video into an emotional call-to-action."

**The Client**
The University of Memphis is a cornerstone of education and culture in the region. In 2022, they were in the final stages of developing their new state-of-the-art music school, the Scheidt Performing Arts Centerâ€”a future hub for students, faculty, and the entire Memphis arts community.

**The Challenge**
With the landmark Scheidt Performing Arts Center nearing completion, the university's funding and donation drive had lost momentum. The UofM team needed a powerful tool to re-engage their donor list and secure the final, critical contributions.

The initial brief was for a traditional, exposition-heavy video with a standard voiceover. We at 80F Creative identified a crucial opportunity: to truly move donors to action, we needed to go beyond simple information and create a genuine emotional connection.

**The Solution**
80F Creative pivoted the creative direction from exposition to emotion. We proposed and developed a cinematic, documentary-style film that put the people at the heart of the story.

Instead of a narrator, we featured faculty and students speaking directly to the viewer, sharing their passion and the profound impact the new center would have on their lives. To bridge the gap between the present and the future, we staged current students in the unfinished space in cinematic ways, even projecting the building's architectural plans onto the walls. This visually connected the people at the heart of the school to the building's future potential and legacy.

This authentic, heartfelt approach was amplified by a custom-composed score, designed to build emotional resonance and drive home the importance of the project. We moved beyond just showing the building and instead focused on the meaning of the building.

**The Results**
The final film was a powerful and moving piece that deeply resonated with the client and, most importantly, their donor base.

Upon distributing the video through their newsletter, the University of Memphis successfully re-ignited donor engagement, securing the necessary funding to complete the Scheidt Performing Arts Center. The campaign ensured the building would open its doors, creating a lasting legacy for students, teachers, alumni, and guests for generations to come.
