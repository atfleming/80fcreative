Here is a clear, organized plan that integrates all our recommendations.

This plan is designed to systematically evolve your website from a personal portfolio into a full-fledged creative agency site, using your newsletter strategy as a key pillar for building authority.

### **The 4-Phase Agency Website Plan**

Your goal is to shift the website's focus from "Here is *my* work" to "Here is *how we solve client problems*."

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Repositioning (Immediate Wins)**

*These are high-impact changes you can make quickly to immediately change a visitor's perception.*

* **Step 1\. Showcase Your Social Proof (Above the Fold).**  
  * **Action:** Your "About" section lists top-tier clients (Stax Records, FedEx, Complex, CNN). This is your single most valuable asset.  
  * **To-Do:** Create a "Trusted By" or "Our Clients" logo bar. Place this on your homepage, near the top, right below your main value proposition. This instantly builds agency-level credibility.  
* **Step 2\. Reframe Your Core Copy from "Me" to "We."**  
  * **Action:** Change the site's language to speak as an agency (80F Creative) rather than just an individual (Andrew Trent Fleming).  
  * **To-Do (Homepage):** Change the line "portfolio for filmmaker and creative, andrew trent fleming" to an agency-focused statement.  
    * **Example:** "80F Creative is a digital agency that helps brands like FedEx and CNN tell compelling stories through film, photography, and design."  
  * **To-Do (About Page):** Keep the "About Drew" bioâ€”it's excellent for building personal trust. But *add* a main "About 80F Creative" section above it that describes the *agency's* philosophy, mission, and process.

#### **Phase 2: Content Elevation (Building Agency-Level Proof)**

*This is the most critical step, mirroring the basicagency.com strategy. You will turn "Projects" into "Case Studies."*

* **Step 3\. Create In-Depth Case Studies.**  
  * **Action:** Select your top 3-4 projects (especially those for your biggest clients). Give each project its own dedicated page.  
  * **To-Do:** Structure each case study page like a story:  
    1. **The Client:** Who they are.  
    2. **The Challenge:** What was the business problem or creative brief? (e.g., "Stax Records needed to launch a new artist...").  
    3. **The Solution:** What was your creative strategy and process? (e.g., "We developed a creative direction focused on...").  
    4. **The Results:** What was the outcome? This is key. (e.g., "The campaign led to X number of views," "The video was featured in...", "The client saw a...").  
    5. **Visuals:** Include your best photos and embed the final video.

#### **Phase 3: Authority Building (The "Insights" Engine)**

*This implements your newsletter idea to establish you as an expert, filling the "Thought Leadership" gap.*

* **Step 4\. Build Your "Insights" & Newsletter Framework.**  
  * **Action:** Create the "Publish and Push" model we discussed. You will own your content on your site first, then distribute it.  
  * **To-Do (Create the Hub):**  
    1. Add a new, top-level page to your website. Call it "Insights," "Thinking," or "Blog."  
    2. This page will be the public archive for all your expert content.  
  * **To-Do (Establish the Workflow):**  
    1. **Publish First:** When you write your newsletter, publish the full article on your "Insights" page. This creates a permanent, SEO-friendly asset.  
    2. **Push Second:** Send your newsletter to your email list. You can either include the full article or send a summary with a "Read the full story" link that drives your subscribers back to your website.  
  * **To-Do (Capture Leads):**  
    1. Add a newsletter subscription form in key, high-traffic locations:  
       * On your new "Insights" page.  
       * At the end of every article you publish.  
       * In the footer of your website.

#### **Phase 4: Final Polish (User Experience & Conversion)**

*This ties everything together, making the site easy to navigate and ensuring visitors know what to do next.*

* **Step 5\. Implement a Clear Agency Navigation.**  
  * **Action:** Your current navigation is minimal. An agency site needs to be clear and directive.  
  * **To-Do:** Create a persistent header navigation menu that includes these key items:  
    * **Work** (Links to your new Case Studies)  
    * **Insights** (Links to your new Blog/Newsletter Hub)  
    * **Services** (Your existing list is good)  
    * **About** (The updated page from Step 2\)  
    * **Contact** (A clear link to your form)  
* **Step 6\. Strengthen Your Calls-to-Action (CTAs).**  
  * **Action:** Guide the visitor on what to do next. Your "Work With Me" form is good, but it can be promoted more actively.  
  * **To-Do:** Add clear, button-based CTAs throughout the site.  
    * **Examples:** "Start Your Project," "Work With Us," or "Let's Talk."  
    * **Placement:** Add these buttons to your Homepage, at the end of each Case Study, and on your "Services" page. All of them should link to your contact form.
